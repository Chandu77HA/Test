Jim was a master at helping people understand the truths, the laws, and the practices that lead to real, lasting success. Jim taught us that achievement is not about luck; it\u2019s really a science. Sure, everyone is different, but the same laws of success always apply. You reap what you sow; you can\u2019t get out of life what you\u2019re not willing to put into it. If you want more love, give more love. If you want greater success, help others achieve more. And when you study and master the science of achievement, you will fi  nd the success you desire. \nDarren Hardy is living proof of this philosophy. He walks the \ntalk. What he shares in his book is based on what has worked in his life\u2014and mine as well. \nThis is a guy who has taken simple but profound fundamentals \nof what it takes to be successful and used them to earn more than a million dollars a year by age twenty-four, and build a company to more than $50 million by age twenty-seven. For the past twenty years, his life has been a personal laboratory of study and research on the topic of success. He\u2019s used himself as a guinea pig, testing thousands of different ideas, resources, and tools, and through his failings and his triumphs, he\u2019s fi  gured out which ideas and strategies have merit, and which ones are just plain BS. \nFor sixteen years, I have crossed paths with Darren, who as a \nleader in the personal-development industry, has worked closely with hundreds of top writers, speakers, and thought leaders. He has trained tens of thousands of entrepreneurs, advised many large companies, and personally mentored dozens of top CEOs and high-performance achievers, extracting from them what really matters and really works, and what doesn\u2019t.

Once you do, there is nothing you can\u2019t obtain or achieve. \nThe Compound Effect  is based on a principle I\u2019ve used in my \nown life and training; that is, your decisions shape your destiny. The future is what you make of it. Little, everyday decisions will either take you to the life you desire or to disaster by default. In fact, it\u2019s the littlest decisions that shape our lives. Stray off course by just two millimeters, and your trajectory changes; what seemed like a tiny, inconsequential decision then can become a mammoth miscalculation now. From what to eat and where to work, to the people you spend your time with, to how you spend your afternoon, every choice shapes how you live today, but more important, how you live the rest of your life. But the good news is, change is within you. In the same way a two-millimeter miscalculation can send you veering wildly off your life\u2019s course, a mere two-millimeter readjustment can also bring you right back home. The trick is fi  nding the plan, the guide, the map that shows you where that home is. How you get there.

You\u2019ve been bamboozled for too long. There is no magic bullet, secret formula, or quick fi  x.

It would be great if you could buy your success, fame, self-esteem, good relationships, and health and well-being in a nicely clam-shelled package at the local Walmart. But, that\u2019s not how it works. \nWe are constantly bombarded with increasingly sensational \nclaims to get rich, get fi  t, get younger, get sexier\u2026 all overnight with little effort for only three easy payments of $39.95. These repetitive marketing messages have distorted our sense of what it really takes to succeed.

You can immediately implement in your life the exercises and time-tested \nsuccess principles this book contains to produce measurable and sustainable results. I\u2019m going to teach you to harness the power of the Compound Effect, the operating system that has been running your life, for better or worse. Use this system to your advantage and you truly can revolutionize your life. You have heard you can achieve anything you set your mind to, right? Well, only if you know how. The Compound Effect  is the operator\u2019s \nmanual that teaches you how to master the system. When you do, there is nothing you can\u2019t obtain or achieve. \nHow do I know that the Compound Effect is the only process you \nneed for ultimate success? Firstly, I have applied these principles to my own life. Now I hate it when authors beat their chests about their fame and fortune, but it\u2019s important you know I speak from personal experience\u2014I\u2019m offering you living proof, not regurgitated theory. As Anthony Robbins mentioned, I\u2019ve enjoyed signifi  cant success in my business endeavors because I\u2019ve made it a point to live by the principles you\u2019ll read in this book. For the past twenty years I\u2019ve been intensely studying success and human achievement. I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars testing thousands of different ideas, resources, and philosophies. My personal experience has proven that, no matter what you learn or what strategy or tactic you employ, success comes as the result of the operating system of the Compound Effect. \nSecondly, for the past sixteen years I have been a leader in \nthe personal-development industry.

All day, every day, I am consuming, sorting, fi  ltering, and wading through an ocean of personal-achievement information. \nHere\u2019s my point. When you have such an exhaustive view of this \nindustry, and wisdom gained through studying the teachings and best practices of some the world\u2019s most successful people, an amazing clarity emerges\u2014the underlying fundamental truths become crystal clear. Having seen it, read it, and heard most all of it, I can no longer be fooled by the latest gambit or self-proclaimed prophet with the newest \u201cscientifi  c breakthrough.\u201d Nobody can sell me on gimmicks. I have too many reference points. I\u2019ve gone down too many roads and learned the truth the hard way.

The process is laborious, tedious, sometimes even boring. Becoming wealthy, infl  uential, and world-class in your fi  eld is \nslow and arduous. Don\u2019t get me wrong; you\u2019ll see results in your life from following these steps almost immediately. But if you have an aversion to work, discipline, and commitment, you\u2019re welcome to turn the TV back on and put your hope in the next infomercial\u2014the one touting promises of overnight success, if you have access to a major credit card. \nHere\u2019s the bottom line: You already know all that you need to \nsucceed. You don\u2019t need to learn anything more. If all we needed was more information, everyone with an Internet connection would live in a mansion, have abs of steel, and be blissfully happy.

Do one thousand free throws every day for a month. Not good at dribbling with your left hand? Tie your right hand behind your back and dribble three hours a day. Behind in your math? Hunker down, hire a tutor, and work like hell all summer until you get it. No excuses. If you aren\u2019t good at something, work harder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too. Dad went from being a football coach to a top salesperson. From there he became the boss, and ultimately, went on to own his own company. \nBut I wasn\u2019t given loads of instruction. From the beginning, \nDad let us fi  gure it out. He was all about taking personal responsibility. He didn\u2019t hammer on us every night about homework; we just had to show up with the results. And, when you did, you were celebrated. If we got good grades, Dad took us to Prings, an ice cream parlor where you could get these king banana splits\u2014six scoops of ice cream and all the fi  xings! Many times my siblings didn\u2019t fare as well in school, so they didn\u2019t get to go. Getting to go was a big deal, so you worked your butt off to win the trip. \nDad\u2019s discipline served as an example for me. Dad was my \nidol, and I wanted him to be proud of me. I also lived in fear of disappointing him.

What\u2019s most interesting about this process to me is that, even though the results are massive, the steps, in the moment, don\u2019t feel signifi  cant. Whether you\u2019re \nusing this strategy for improving your health, relationships, fi  nances, or anything else for that matter, the changes are so subtle, they\u2019re almost imperceptible. These small changes offer little or no immediate result, no big win, no obvious I-told-you-so payoff. So why bother? \nMost people get tripped up by the simplicity of the Compound \nEffect. For instance, they quit after the eighth day of running because they\u2019re still overweight.

Yet why is it so hard to believe choosing the penny will result in more money in the end? Because it takes so much longer to see the \npayoff. Let\u2019s take a closer look. \nLet\u2019s say you take the cold, hard cash and your friend goes the \npenny route. On Day Five, your friend has sixteen cents. You, however, have $3 million. On Day Ten, it\u2019s $5.12 versus your big bucks. How do you think your friend is feeling about her decision? You\u2019re spending your millions, enjoying the heck out of it, and loving your choice. \nAfter 20 full days, with only 11 days left, Penny Lane has \nonly $5,243.

We become like the frog in the boiling water that doesn\u2019t jump to his freedom because the warming is so incremental and insidious that he doesn\u2019t notice he\u2019s getting cooked! \nIf we want to succeed, we need to recover our grandparents\u2019 \nwork ethic. \nIt\u2019s time to restore our character, if not for the sake of saving \nAmerica, at least for your own greater success and achievement.

Real and lasting success requires work\u2014and lots of it! \nI have a quick, real-time story to illustrate this nothing-fails-like \nsuccess concept: A great new restaurant opened up close to my home on the beach in San Diego. In the beginning, the place was always immaculate, the hostess had a big, welcoming smile for everyone, the service was impeccable (the manager came over and assured it), and the food was sensational. Soon, people started lining up to eat there and would often wait more than an hour to be seated. \nThen, unfortunately, the restaurant\u2019s staff began to take its \nsuccess for granted. The hostess became snooty, the service staff disheveled and curt, and the food quality hit-or-miss. The place was out of business within eighteen months. They failed because  \nof their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing what made them successful to begin with. Their success clouded their perspective and they slacked off. \nMicrowave Mentality \nUnderstanding the Compound Effect will rid you of \u201cinsta-\nresults\u201d expectation\u2014the belief success should be as fast as your fast food, your one-hour glasses, your thirty-minute photo processing, your overnight mail, your microwave eggs, your instant hot water and text messaging.

Every choice has an impact on the Compound Effect of your life. \nThis chapter is about becoming aware of and making choices \nthat support the expansion of your life. Sounds complicated, but you\u2019ll be amazed by its simplicity. No longer will 99 percent of your choices be unconscious. No more will most of your daily routines and traditions come as a reaction to your programming.

Our choices are often shaped by our culture and upbringing. They can be so entwined in our routine behaviors and habits that they seem beyond our control. For instance, have you ever been going about your business, enjoying your life, when all of sudden you made a stupid choice or series of small choices that ultimately sabotaged your hard work and momentum, all for no apparent reason? You didn\u2019t intend to sabotage yourself, but by not thinking about \nChapter_2.indd   24Chapter_2.indd   24 4/21/10   12:58:52 PM4/21/10   12:58:52 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1965, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ae2af01-4798-475a-bc2a-d234eb6462e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ae2af01-4798-475a-bc2a-d234eb6462e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_45.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_45.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 59263, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_45.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_45.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 59263, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "0962591e5472c1c0e7a5d8407660c37049a99aa554cb88d2cabcdca9007ccdf0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "732c1813-45fb-4906-bf6e-ad86f0eb070a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_44.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_44.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 61942, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "91d85db89464cc5a3f3afe10843c6550097f2f198d2f21f8fcc6492ab5e1bc41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6605e6b8-a49d-4b8d-a8f3-3a0d8987dbbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5281d53877e3c2e9ddb9587097402f06734f3420f8ef677d15e8d3b7f86a426b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "25 CHOICES\nyour decisions\u2014weighing the risks and potential outcomes\u2014you found yourself facing unintended consequences.

Back in my early twenties, when I was making a lot of money selling real estate, I met with my accountant. \n\u201cYou owe well over $100,000 in taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat?!\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of cash just \nlying around.\u201d \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou collected several times that; certainly \nyou set aside the taxes that would be due on that money.\u201d \n\u201cEvidently I didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere did the money go?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, a sobering confession, for sure. The \nmoney had passed through my hands like water, and I hadn\u2019t even noticed! \nThen my accountant did me a great favor. \u201cSon,\u201d he said, looking me dead in the eyes, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to get a \ngrip. I\u2019ve seen this a hundred times before. You\u2019re spending money like a drunken fool, and you don\u2019t even know how to account for it. That\u2019s stupid. Stop it.

Continue this, and you\u2019ll dig your fi  nancial grave with your own wallet.\u201d \nI immediately got the message. Here\u2019s what my accountant had me do: carry a small notepad \nin my back pocket, and write down every single cent I spent for thirty days. Whether it was a thousand dollars for a new suit or fi  fty cents for air to fi  ll up my tires, it all had to go down on the notepad. Wow. This brought an instantaneous awareness of the many unconscious choices I was making that resulted in money pouring out of my pockets. Because I had to log everything, I resisted buying some things, just so I didn\u2019t have to take out the notepad and write it in the dang book! \nKeeping a money log for thirty days straight cemented a new \nawareness in me, and created a completely new set of choices and disciplines around my spending. And, since awareness and positive behaviors compound, I found myself being more proactive with money in general, putting away more for retirement, fi  nding areas to save where there was clear waste, and enjoying the fun quotient of money\u2014\u201cplay money\u201d\u2014all the more. When I did consider shelling out for entertainment, I did so only after a long pause. \nThis tracking exercise changed my awareness of how I \nrelated to my money. It worked so well, in fact, that I\u2019ve used it many times to change other behaviors. Tracking is my go-to transformation model for everything that ails me. Over the years I\u2019ve tracked what I eat and drink, how much I exercise, how much time I spend improving a skill, my number of sales calls, even the improvement of my relationships with family, friends, \nChapter_2.indd   36Chapter_2.indd   36 4/21/10   12:59:21 PM4/21/10   12:59:21 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1802, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0adb83a-35a7-43c0-a2f7-c479bc6e1f33": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0adb83a-35a7-43c0-a2f7-c479bc6e1f33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_57.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_57.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 53069, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_57", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_57.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_57.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 53069, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "66edc8bf9a01a54e12063a551609d69ed026da776251e74d28604e1154ca1533", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "812944d7-5642-4833-b9f2-9269cdce64f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_56.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_56.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 61842, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "c495072925e34a9837f1de5fb9f75448032cda40da018731e5a4e386ea46e8ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b92c7d5-872d-457c-a354-91e4eaacdbbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50dc8922c3acdb7eecf454448bf52c8bd723d01e825201e121f9de1bd4676adf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "37 CHOICES\nor my spouse.

Why do Olympic trainers get paid top dollar? Because they track every workout, every calorie, and every micronutrient for their athletes. All winners are trackers. Right now I want you to track your life with the same intention: to bring your goals within sight. \nTracking is a simple exercise. It works because it brings \nmoment-to-moment awareness to the actions you take in the area of your life you want to improve. You\u2019ll be surprised at what you will observe about your behavior. You cannot manage or improve something until you measure it. Likewise, you can\u2019t make the most of who you are\u2014your talents and resources and capabilities\u2014until you are aware of and accountable for your actions.

This one action isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s simple and doable. So do it. \nPromise yourself to start. Today. For the next three weeks, choose \nto carry around your own small notepad (or large one, if that\u2019s more enticing), and write every single thing down in your category.  \nWhat happens in three weeks? You move from the shock that \nfollows the fi  rst week to the happy surprise of seeing how merely becoming conscious of your actions begins to shape them. You\u2019ll fi  nd yourself asking, \u201cDo I really want that candy bar? I\u2019m gonna have to haul out my notebook and write it down, and I\u2019ll feel a little sheepish.\u201d That\u2019s two hundred calories saved right there.

How much do you really need to stop for coffee? See Figure 3.\nCome again? Am I saying that your four-dollar-a-day coffee \nhabit is going to cost you $51,833.79 in twenty years? Yes, I am. Did you know that every dollar you spend today, no matter where you spend it, is costing you nearly fi  ve dollars in only twenty years (and ten dollars in thirty years)? That\u2019s because if you took a dollar and invested it at 8 percent, in twenty years, that dollar would be worth almost fi  ve. Every time you spend a buck today, it\u2019s like taking fi  ve dollars out of your future pocket. \nI used to make the mistake of looking at a price tag and thinking \nthat if an item was listed at fi  fty dollars, it cost me fi  fty dollars.

Phil was an entrepreneur and founder of the company. The company was doing fi  ne, but I detected a lack of engagement, trust, and enthusiasm in the culture of his organization. I wasn\u2019t too surprised; it turns out that Phil hadn\u2019t been in parts of his own building for more than fi  ve years! He\u2019d never spoken personally to more than 80 percent of his staff! He basically lived in a bubble with his management team. I asked Phil to track just one change: three times a week, he had to step outside of his offi  ce and walk around the building. His goal was to seek out at least three people whom he saw doing things right or had heard good things about and give them some personal acknowledgment of his appreciation. This one small change in his behavior took less than an hour a week, but had massive effects over time. The employees Phil took the time to recognize began to go the extra mile and work harder to earn his greater appreciation.

All because Phil committed to one small, seemingly insignifi  cant step done consistently over time. \nMoney Tree\nTwelve years ago I had a wonderful assistant, Kathleen. She \nearned $40,000 a year at the time. She was tasked to manage the registration table situated at the back of the room during one of my lectures on entrepreneurship and wealth building. The next week she came into my offi  ce. \u201cI heard you talk about saving 10 percent of everything you earn,\u201d she told me. \u201cThat sounds nice, but there is no way I could do that. It\u2019s totally unrealistic!\u201d She proceeded to tell me about all her bills and fi  nancial obligations. After she wrote them all out, it was obvious there really wasn\u2019t any money left over at the end of the month. \u201cI need a raise,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI\u2019ll do better than that,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you how \nto become wealthy.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the answer she was looking for, but she agreed. \nI taught Kathleen how to track her spending, and she began to \ncarry her notebook. I told her to open a separate savings account with only $33\u2014just 1 percent of her existing monthly income.

The next month I had her save only 2 percent ($67). She saved the additional $33 by changing her cable subscription service. The next month we went up to 3 percent. We canceled her subscription to People magazine (it \nwas time to study her own life), and instead of going to Starbucks \ntwice a week, I told Kathleen to buy the Starbucks beans and other fancy fi  xings and make her own coffee in the offi  ce (she grew to like that even better\u2014me too!). \nBy the end of the year, Kathleen was saving 10 percent of every \ndollar she earned without noticing a signifi  cant impact on her lifestyle. She was amazed! That one discipline also had a ripple effect on many other disciplines in her life. She calculated what she spent on mind-numbing entertainment and began investing that money on personal growth instead. After feeding her mind with several hundred hours of inspirational and instructional content, her creativity started to soar. She brought me several ideas on how we could make and save more money in our organization. She presented me with a plan that she would implement in her spare time, if I promised to reward her with 10 percent of all the money-saving strategies and 15 percent of all the new revenue strategies that proved profi  table. By the end of the second year, she was earning more than $100,000 a year\u2014on the same $40,000 base salary. Kathleen eventually started her own independent contract service business that took off.

Suppose your friend listened to Dave Ramsey\u2019s advice and began putting $250 a month into an IRA when she got her fi  rst job after graduating from college at age twenty-three. You, on the other hand, don\u2019t start saving until you\u2019re forty. (Or maybe you started saving a little earlier but cleaned out your retirement account because you didn\u2019t notice any great gains.) By the time your friend is forty, she never has to invest another dollar and will have more than a $1 million by the age of sixty-seven, growing at 8 percent interest compounded monthly. You continue to invest $250 every month until you reach sixty-seven, the normal retirement age for Social Security for those born after 1960. (That means you\u2019re saving for twenty-seven years in contrast to her seventeen years.) When you\u2019re ready to retire, you\u2019ll have less than $300,000 and will have invested $27,000 more than your friend. Even though you saved for many more years and invested much more cash, you still ended up with less than a third of the money you could have had. That\u2019s what happens when we procrastinate and neglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. Don\u2019t wait another day to start the small disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your goals! See Figure 5.\nAre you telling yourself that you\u2019re starting so late that \nyou\u2019re already way behind the eight ball and can never catch up? That\u2019s just another tired tape in your head; it\u2019s time to turn it off. It\u2019s never too late to reap the benefi  ts of the Compound Effect.

The key is to start NOW. Every great act, every fantastic adventure, starts with small steps. The fi  rst step always looks harder than it actually is.\n But what if twenty-fi  ve years is too long? What if you\u2019ve only \ngot time or patience for ten years? In Brian Tracy\u2019s book Focal \nPoint (Amacom, 2002), he models how to improve any area of \nyour life by 1,000 percent. Not 10 percent or even 100 percent, but 1,000 percent! Let me outline it for you. \nAll you have to do is improve yourself, your performance, and \nyour output and earnings by 1/10 of 1 percent each workday (you even get to slack off on weekends). That is 1/1,000. Do you think you could do that? Of course, anyone could do that. Simple. Do it each day of the week, and you\u2019ll improve by \u00bd percent each week (translation: not much), equaling 2 percent each month, which, compounded, adds up to 26 percent each year. Your income now doubles each 2.9 years. By Year Ten, you can be performing and earning 1,000 percent what you are now. Isn\u2019t that amazing? You don\u2019t have to put in 1,000 percent more effort or work 1,000 percent more hours. Just 1/10 of 1 percent improvement each day. That\u2019s it. \nSuccess Is a (Half-) Marathon \nBeverly was a salesperson for an educational software \ncompany for which I was doing a turnaround.

If you\u2019ve ever tried to lose weight, you probably know the drill: Buy an expensive gym membership, drop a fortune on personal trainers, new equipment, spiffy new workout clothes, and great athletic footwear. Work out vigorously for a week or so and then turn your elliptical machine into a clothes-drying rack, ditch the gym, and let your sneakers mold in the corner. I wanted to try a better way with Beverly. I knew that if I could get her to choose just one new habit, she\u2019d \nget hooked, and all the other behaviors would naturally fall into line. \nI asked Beverly to drive her car around the block and map out \na one-mile loop from her house. Then, I told her to walk the loop three times over a period of two weeks. Notice that I didn\u2019t ask her to start by running the mile. Instead, I started with something\u2014a small, easy task that required no major stretch. Then I had her walk the loop three times in one week for an additional two weeks.

It took three more weeks\u2014nine outings\u2014before she could jog a full mile. After a total of seven weeks, she was jogging the whole loop. That might seem like a long time for such a short victory, right? After all, half of a marathon is 13.1 miles. One mile is nothing.

Within six months, she was running nine miles without any discomfort at all. In nine months, she was running 13.5 miles regularly (more than the distance of a half-marathon) as part of her running routine. More exciting, though, was what happened in other areas of her life. Beverly lost her cravings for chocolate (a lifelong obsession) and heavy, fatty foods. Gone. The increased energy she felt from the cardiovascular exercise and better eating choices helped her bring more enthusiasm to her work. Her sales performance doubled during the same period (which was great for me!). \nAs we saw in the previous chapter, the ripple effects of all \nthis momentum raised her self-esteem which made her more affectionate toward her husband.

If you had to consciously think about every step of each ordinary task\u2014making breakfast, driving the kids to school, getting to work, and so on\u2014your life would grind to a halt. You probably brush your teeth twice a day on autopilot. There\u2019s no big philosophical debate; you just do it. You strap on your seatbelt the minute your butt hits the seat. No second thoughts. Our habits and routines allow us to use minimal conscious energy for everyday tasks. They help keep us sane and enable us to handle most situations reasonably well. And because we don\u2019t have to think about the mundane, we can focus our mental energy on more creative and enriching thoughts. Habits can be helpful\u2014as long as they\u2019re good habits, that is. \nIf you eat healthfully, you\u2019ve likely built healthy habits around \nthe food you buy and what you order at restaurants. If you\u2019re fi  t, it\u2019s probably because you work out regularly.

How did he do it? \nIt was Larry\u2019s habits\u2014his relentless dedication to practice and to \nimprove his game. Bird was one of the most consistent free-throw shooters in the history of the NBA. Growing up, his habit was to practice fi  ve hundred free-throw shots every morning before school. With that kind of discipline, Larry made the most of his God-given talents and kicked the butts of some of the most \u201cgifted\u201d players on the court. \nLike Larry Bird, you can condition your automatic and \nunconscious responses to be those of a developed champion. This chapter is about choosing to make up for what you lack in innate ability with discipline, hard work, and good habits. It\u2019s about becoming a creature of champion habits. \nWith enough practice and repetition, any behavior, good or \nbad, becomes automatic over time. That means that even though we developed most of our habits unconsciously (by modeling our parents, responding to environmental or cultural associations, or creating coping mechanisms), we can consciously decide to change them.

But that doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t activated the Compound Effect. \nIt\u2019s time to WAKE UP and realize that the habits you \nindulge in could be compounding your life into repeated disaster. The slightest adjustments to your daily routines can dramatically alter the outcomes in your life. Again, I\u2019m not talking about quantum leaps of change or a complete overhaul of your personality, character, and life. Supersmall, seemingly inconsequential adjustments can and will revolutionize everything. \nThe best illustration I can give you to emphasize the power of \nsmall adjustments is that of a plane traveling from Los Angeles to New York City. If the nose of the plane is pointed only 1 percent off course\u2014almost an invisible adjustment when the plane\u2019s sitting on the tarmac in Los Angeles\u2014it will ultimately end up about 150 miles off course, arriving either upstate in Albany or in Dover, Delaware. Such is the case for your habits. A single poor habit, which doesn\u2019t look like much in the moment, can ultimately lead you miles off course from the direction of your goals and the life you desire. See Figure 6.\nMost people drift through life without devoting much \nconscious energy to fi  guring out specifi  cally what they want and \nwhat they need to do to take themselves there. I want to show you how to ignite your passion and help you aim your unstoppable creative power in the direction of your heart\u2019s dreams and desires. Uprooting bad habits that have grown into mighty oaks is going to be arduous and diffi  cult; to see the process through will require \nChapter_3.indd   60Chapter_3.indd   60 4/21/10   1:00:27 PM4/21/10   1:00:27 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1829, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "265989a5-a97d-4bd3-875a-f05e753fbef5": {"__data__": {"id_": "265989a5-a97d-4bd3-875a-f05e753fbef5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_81.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_81.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 63047, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_81", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_81.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_81.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 63047, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "4af5bafc7361c65fbbb460dce5cda5dc29b74d7e06c282276037d36030684434", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "113ea938-61bf-44db-9d3f-6c74dea4383d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_80.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_80.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52040, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "7cbac92fdedd41223ed8e593c62c33e744ff13d25590a62fde9b7a5f621a9f68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0677f014-5bed-458d-921b-0f0a96e438f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "48ce08c7bda0c020372b44861eb852fa806e7f0032f160693448fd48313fd887", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "61 HABITS\nFig. 6\nNew York City\nDelawareAlbany\nLos Angeles\nsomething greater than even the most relentless determination\u2014\nwillpower alone won\u2019t cut it. \nFinding Your Mojo\u2014Your Why-Power \nAssuming willpower is what you need to change your habits \nis akin to trying to keep a hungry grizzly bear out of your picnic basket by covering the it with a napkin.

That same twenty dollars for walking the thirty-foot plank no longer looks desirable or even possible, does it? You\u2019d look at me and say, \u201cNot on your life.\u201d See Figure 7.\nHowever, if your child was on the opposite building, and \nthat building was on fi  re, would you walk the length of the plank to save him?

I\u2019m a connoisseur of nice things. But material stuff can\u2019t really recruit your heart, soul, and guts into the fi  ght. That passion has to come from a deeper place. And, even if you acquire the shiny object(s), you won\u2019t capture the real prize\u2014happiness and fulfi  llment. In my interview with peak-performance expert Anthony Robbins ( SUCCESS, January \n2009), he said: \u201cI have seen business moguls achieve their ultimate goals, but still live in frustration, worry, and fear. What\u2019s preventing these successful people from being happy? The answer is they have focused only on achievement and not fulfi  llment. Extraordinary accomplishment does not guarantee extraordinary joy, happiness, love, and a sense of meaning. These two skill sets feed off each other, and makes me believe that success without fulfi  llment is failure.\u201d \nWell said. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not enough to choose to be successful. \nYou have to dig deeper than that to fi  nd your core motivation, to activate your superpower. Your why-power. \nCore Motivation \nThe access point to your why-power is through your core \nvalues, which defi  ne both who you are and what you stand for. Your core values are your internal compass, your guiding beacon, your personal GPS. They act as the fi  lter through which you run all of life\u2019s demands, requests, and temptations, making sure they\u2019re leading you toward your intended destination.

Our brain is always \ntrying to align our outer world with what we\u2019re seeing and \nexpecting in our inner world. So, when you instruct your brain \nto look for the things you want, you will begin to see them. In \nfact, the object of your desire has probably always existed around \nyou, but your mind and eyes weren\u2019t open to \u201cseeing\u201d it. \nIn reality, this is how the Law of Attraction  really works. It is \nnot the mysterious, esoteric voodoo it sometimes sounds like. \nIt\u2019s far simpler and more practical than that. \nWe are bombarded with billions of sensory (visual, audio, \nphysical) bites of information each day. To keep ourselves from \ngoing insane, we ignore 99.9 percent of them, only really seeing, \nhearing, or experiencing those upon which our mind focuses. \nThis is why, when you \u201cthink\u201d something, it appears that you are \nmiraculously drawing it into your life. In reality, you\u2019re now just \nseeing what was already there. You are truly \u201cattracting\u201d it into \nyour life.

It seems like there are tons of them on the streets all of a sudden when they weren\u2019t there yesterday. But is that realistic? Of course not. They were there all along, but you weren\u2019t paying attention to them. Thus, they didn\u2019t really \u201cexist\u201d to you until you gave them your attention. \nWhen you defi  ne your goals, you give your brain something \nnew to look for and focus on. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re giving your mind a new set of eyes from which to see all the people, circumstances, conversations, resources, ideas, and creativity surrounding you. With this new perspective (an inner itinerary), your mind proceeds to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside\u2014your goal. It\u2019s that simple. The difference in how you experience the world and draw ideas, people, and opportunities into your life after you have clearly defi  ned your goals is profound. \nIn one of my interviews with Brian Tracy, he put it this way: \n\u201cTop people have very clear goals. They know who they are and they know what they want. They write it down and they make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a can, and we say a goal that is not in writing is merely a fantasy. And everybody has fantasies, but those fantasies are like bullets with no powder in the cartridge. People go through life shooting blanks without written goals\u2014and that\u2019s the starting point.\u201d \nChapter_3.indd   71Chapter_3.indd   71 4/21/10   1:00:57 PM4/21/10   1:00:57 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1917, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e3f4c47-f91c-40ac-abb3-9c3c254cd6d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e3f4c47-f91c-40ac-abb3-9c3c254cd6d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_92.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_92.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 145097, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_92", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_92.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_92.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 145097, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "6822cd45d0bd1cf20cced88b231e7647b098778f91199162d06923d11f9ab9aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "81aaf447-09c8-4be7-9bb8-0871839b531f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_91.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_91.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 42820, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "1455be4cd5f085bb13dabf08a1a74bce64270bc10afec640b947e4f4b7609196", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2a103bb-a6b9-424e-9fee-559b4517af40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d3c80da65c5e0e5345a243650ae1516e6cbffe65fee77271841537ea9a66a76d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "72 THE COMPOUND  EFFECT\nI suggest that you take some time today  to make a list of your \nmost important goals.

In fact, he was getting very little valuable information through his programming choices\u2014or, rather, his lack of choices. \nSo why did he spend nearly four hours a day consuming it?

If \nyou want to sail your life in a new direction, you have to fi  rst pick up the anchors of bad habits that have been weighing you down. The key is to make your why-power so strong that it overwhelms your urges for instant gratifi  cation. And for that, you need a new game plan. The following are my all-time favorite game changers: \n1. Identify Your TriggersLook at your list of bad habits. For each one you\u2019ve written \ndown, identify what triggers it. Figure out what I call \u201cThe Big 4\u2019s\u201d\u2014the \u201cwho,\u201d the \u201cwhat,\u201d the \u201cwhere,\u201d and the \u201cwhen\u201d underlying each bad behavior. For example: \nAre you more likely to drink too much when you\u2019re with \u2022 \ncertain people? Is there a particular time of day when you just \u2022 have to have \nsomething sweet? What emotions tend to provoke your worst habits\u2014stress, \u2022 \nfatigue, anger, nervousness, boredom? When do you experience those emotions? Who are you \u2022 \nwith, where are you, or what are you doing?

Conferences? Social settings? Feeling physically insecure? Deadlines? Take a closer look at your routines. What do you typically \u2022 \nsay when you wake up? When you\u2019re on a coffee or lunch break? When you\u2019ve gotten home from a long day? \nAgain, get out your notebook or use the Bad Habit Killer \nWorksheet here (which you can also download for free at www.TheCompoundEffect.com/free) and write down your triggers. This simple action alone increases your awareness exponentially. But, of course, this isn\u2019t the whole enchilada, because as we\u2019ve discussed, increasing your awareness of a bad habit isn\u2019t enough to break it. \n2. Clean House Get to scrubbin\u2019. And I mean this literally and fi  guratively. If you \nwant to stop drinking alcohol, remove every drop of it from your house (and your vacation house, if you have one). Get rid of the glasses, any fancy utensils or doo-dads you use when you drink, and those decorative olives, too. If you want to stop drinking coffee, heave the coffee maker, and give that bag of gourmet grounds to a sleepy neighbor. If you\u2019re trying to curb your spending, take an evening and cancel every catalogue or retail offer that fl  ies in through your mailbox or your inbox, so you won\u2019t even need to muster the discipline to walk it from the front door to the recycle bin. If you want to eat more healthfully, clean your cupboards of all the crap, stop buying the junk food\u2014and stop buying into the argument that it\u2019s \u201cnot fair\u201d to deny the other people in your family junk food just because you don\u2019t want it in your life. Trust me; everyone in your family is better off without it. Don\u2019t bring it into the house, period. Get rid of whatever enables your bad habits. \nChapter_3.indd   78Chapter_3.indd   78 4/21/10   1:01:16 PM4/21/10   1:01:16 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1830, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aed701ea-5944-426f-b8f7-2e43ff35ed46": {"__data__": {"id_": "aed701ea-5944-426f-b8f7-2e43ff35ed46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_99.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_99.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 51214, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_99", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_99.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_99.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 51214, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "a89be0bb88ba9a21fde03cc1d2c7fe891a21de12b5cc4079099961daf99cb689", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b547fc30-3543-417b-9c33-fad222659c3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_98.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_98.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 60577, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "a6def9c2805d2b2cd285a7ff8f6a035f9cf70723aba5bb328523dbc6f7f0d892", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d152992-ff7a-4dec-930e-8151c25e9b95", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a17d2865500192980b66f6d4f78e93a930ce1fbbe0a04d05cfd28bd497f3e25a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "79 HABITS\n3. Swap It Look again at your list of bad habits. How can you alter \nthem so that they\u2019re not as harmful? Can you replace them with healthier habits or drop-kick them altogether? As in, for good. \nAnyone who knows me knows that I love something sweet \nafter a meal. If there is ice cream in the house, the something sweet turns into a triple-scoop banana split with all the fi  xings (1,255 calories). Instead, I replace that bad habit with two Hershey\u2019s Kisses (50 calories). I\u2019m still able to satisfy the sweet tooth without having to spend the extra hour on the treadmill just to get back to even.  \nMy sister-in-law started a habit of eating crunchy and salty \njunk food when she watched TV . She\u2019d crunch through a whole bag of tortilla chips with little actual awareness. Then she realized that what she really enjoyed was the crunchy sensation in her mouth. She decided to replace her bad habit with crunching on carrot and celery sticks, and raw broccoli spears. She got the same joyful sensation, and her FDA-recommended vegetable servings at the same time. \nA guy who used to work for me had a habit of drinking eight \nto ten Diet Cokes a day (that\u2019s a BAD habit!). I suggested he replace them with low-sodium, carbonated water, adding fresh lemon, lime, or oranges. He did this for about a month before realizing he didn\u2019t need the carbonation at all, and switched to just plain water. \nPlay with this, and see what behaviors you can replace, delete, \nor swap out. \nChapter_3.indd   79Chapter_3.indd   79 4/21/10   1:01:18 PM4/21/10   1:01:18 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1566, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d152992-ff7a-4dec-930e-8151c25e9b95": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d152992-ff7a-4dec-930e-8151c25e9b95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_100.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_100.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70471, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_100", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_100.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_100.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70471, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "b76d743f330be520a8b8241063786adc3aa22bd039717c9923efab0c768d8585", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aed701ea-5944-426f-b8f7-2e43ff35ed46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_99.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_99.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 51214, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "a89be0bb88ba9a21fde03cc1d2c7fe891a21de12b5cc4079099961daf99cb689", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "570af496-ddb5-436e-876b-55d1ca38299b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9009bd7357dff80a4aa4cac2c79be010d3dc86a6f90ff460dae5376a7a84547b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "80 THE COMPOUND EFFECT\n4. Ease In I live near the Pacifi  c Ocean. Whenever I get in the water, I get \nmy ankles acclimated fi  rst, then walk in up to my knees, then it\u2019s my waist and chest, before taking the plunge. Some people just run and dive in and get it over with\u2014good for them. Not me. I like to ease my way in (probably residual trauma from my childhood, as you\u2019ll see in the next strategy). For some of your long-standing and deep-rooted habits, it may be more effective to take small steps to ease into unwinding them. You may have spent decades repeating, cementing, and fortifying those habits, so it can be wise to give yourself some time to unravel them, one step at a time. \nA few years, ago my wife\u2019s doctor required she cut out caffeine \nfrom her diet for several months. We both love our coffee, so if \nshe was going to have to suffer, I decided it was only fair that we do it together.

The lake, situated not far from the Sierras in Northern California, is fed from glaciers that melt from atop the mountains of Lake Tahoe. The water\u2019s ridiculously cold. Every day we were there, my dad insisted that I water ski in the polar pond. All day I would be quietly anxious about the dreaded call to go in. I loved to water ski; I just hated getting in \nthe water. A slight confl  ict of interest, because of course, there was no separating one from the other. \nDad made sure that I never missed my turn, sometimes \nby actually physically throwing me in. After a dozen or so excruciating seconds of near-hypothermia, I always found the water refreshing and rejuvenating. My anticipation of getting in the water was actually worse than the reality of just jumping in. Once my body acclimated, water skiing was a blast. And, yet, I went through this cycle of dread and relief each and every time. \nChapter_3.indd   81Chapter_3.indd   81 4/21/10   1:01:24 PM4/21/10   1:01:24 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1832, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22af8976-7ad7-4077-a360-215d57b7a8fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "22af8976-7ad7-4077-a360-215d57b7a8fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_102.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_102.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 51873, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_102", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_102.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_102.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 51873, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "64d595ebb5a955878a2755daf2911a7214df1894c7a9c005871c1841e92f7900", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "570af496-ddb5-436e-876b-55d1ca38299b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_101.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_101.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52682, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "e382650da230e003adc6823420a683725f848afe51726e0a42194d4c76cb797c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a839e90b-bf3b-47a8-ab41-285677edef81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "54e75eab0b10baeb1b837c8b7df885097de50ff8e8ae150f02dea4520780d395", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "82 THE COMPOUND EFFECT\nThat experience isn\u2019t unlike that of suddenly dropping or \nchanging a bad habit.

And usually, we can regulate ourselves physiologically and psychologically to the new circumstances quite quickly. \nSometimes wading in just won\u2019t do. Sometimes you really do \nhave to jump in. I want you to ask yourself now, \u201cWhere can I start slow and hold myself accountable?\u201d And, \u201cWhere do I need to take that bigger leap? Where have I been avoiding pain or discomfort, when I know deep down that I\u2019ll adapt in no time if I just go for it?\u201d \nOne of my former partners has a brother who was a beer-\nguzzling, bar-brawling, life-of-the-party alcoholic. He drank at lunch, with dinner, after dinner, and all weekend long. One day he was at a wedding for a former college roommate when he saw his friend\u2019s brother, who was ten years older than both of them, but looked ten years younger! He watched the man dance, laugh, and play during the wedding, exuding a vitality he hadn\u2019t felt in many years. He made a decision on the spot that he would never touch a drop of alcohol again. Cold turkey, that was it, never again. And he hasn\u2019t in more than six years. \nWhen it comes to changing bad habits at home, I\u2019m a toe dipper. \nBut in my professional life, I fi  nd that taking the big plunge is far more effective. Whether committing to a new business or dealing with potential new clients, partners, or investors, toe dipping usually doesn\u2019t cut it. Each time, I think of Lake Rollins and know it will be painful at fi  rst, but I remember that within little time, it will be exhilarating, and well worth the temporary discomfort. \nChapter_3.indd   82Chapter_3.indd   82 4/21/10   1:01:27 PM4/21/10   1:01:27 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1963, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a839e90b-bf3b-47a8-ab41-285677edef81": {"__data__": {"id_": "a839e90b-bf3b-47a8-ab41-285677edef81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_103.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 49244, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_103", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_103.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 49244, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "a3acb2878d2405a03e8333696bbe9d943d0b13ca8aaead47df69d46ba12b1c46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22af8976-7ad7-4077-a360-215d57b7a8fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_102.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_102.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 51873, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "64d595ebb5a955878a2755daf2911a7214df1894c7a9c005871c1841e92f7900", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7fb5e29-00b8-4639-8d67-85fbb0e2a906", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bcb88138a2b6b106096560c81bcd91a4b447f577944038fce4086a2a877fe222", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "83 HABITS\nRun a Vice Check \nI\u2019m not suggesting you cut out every \u201cbad\u201d thing in your \nlife.

Doing so takes effort, time, and practice. Here are my favorite techniques for putting good habits in place. \nLeadership expert John C. Maxwell said, \u201cYou will never \nchange your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.\u201d According to research, it takes three hundred instances of positive reinforcement to turn a new habit into an unconscious practice\u2014that\u2019s almost a year of daily practice! Fortunately, as we talked about earlier, we know we\u2019ve got a much better chance of cementing a new habit into our lives after three weeks of diligent focus. That means that if we bring special attention to a new habit daily for the fi  rst three weeks, we have a far better \nchance of making it a lifelong practice. \nThe truth is, you can change a habit in a second, or you can \nstill be trying to break it after ten long years. The fi  rst time you touched a hot stove, you instantly knew you\u2019d never make that a habit! The shock and pain was so intense that it forever changed your awareness; you knew you\u2019d be conscious for the rest of your life around hot stoves. \nThe key is staying aware. If you really want to maintain a \ngood habit, make sure you pay attention to it at least once a day, and you\u2019re far more likely to succeed. \n1. Set Yourself Up to Succeed Any new habit has to work inside your life and lifestyle. If you join \na gym that\u2019s thirty miles away, you won\u2019t go. If you\u2019re a night owl but the gym closes at 6 p.m., it won\u2019t work for you. Your gym must be close and convenient, and fi  t into your schedule.

Want to make sure you don\u2019t binge on vending machine snacks when you get midday hunger pangs? Keep nuts and healthy snacks in your desk drawer. The easiest thing to grab when you\u2019re hungry is empty carbs. One strategy I use is to have protein on hand. I cook up a bunch of chicken on Sunday, and package it and have it ready for the week. \nOne of my most distracting and destructive habits is my e-mail \naddiction. Seriously, this is no laughing matter. I can lose hours of focus every day with the massive amounts of e-mail fl  ooding my inbox if I\u2019m not vigilant about staying organized and focused. To set up the discipline of my new habit of only checking e-mail three times a day, I turned off all alarms, all automatic-receive functions, and shut the program down when I\u2019m not in one of those three windows of allocated time. I have to build the walls around that time vortex, lest I keep falling in all day. \n2.

Instead of thinking that he has to deprive himself, or take something out of his diet (e.g., \u201cI can\u2019t eat a hamburger, chocolate, or dairy\u201d), he thinks about what he can have instead \n(e.g., \u201cToday I\u2019m going to have a salad and steamed vegetables and fresh fi  gs\u201d).

To help out, I asked him what he\u2019d like to do with three hours of free time if he had it. He said he would play with his kids more. I also asked him to pick a hobby he\u2019d always wanted to explore. His choice was photography. A total techie, he went out and got all this high-tech editing equipment, which he happily toted along on more family outings so he could take great photos of his kids. Then he\u2019d spend hours in the evening editing and putting together slide shows and photo albums for the whole family to enjoy. They ended up spending time together, laughing and remembering how much fun they\u2019d had. Because he was so focused on his kids and photography, he no longer had the time nor the desire to sit around and watch TV at night. He realized he\u2019d been zoning out on it because it was an easy mental escape from his workday. By replacing TV viewing with his new habit of playing games with his kids and working on his photography hobby he discovered passions with far more power and far bigger payoffs. \nWhat can you choose to \u201cadd in\u201d so you can enrich your \nlife experience? \n3.

Competition & Camaraderie There\u2019s nothing like a friendly contest to whet your \ncompetitive spirit and immerse yourself in a new habit with a bang. Dr. Mehmet Oz once told me in an interview, \u201cIf people would just walk a thousand more steps per day, they would change their lives\u201d . VideoPlus, the parent company for SUCCESS, held a step competition using shoe pedometers to count steps. Employees organized into teams and competed to see which team could accumulate the most steps. It was amazing to me that people who didn\u2019t previously exercise for their own health or benefi  t suddenly started walking four, fi  ve, \nor six miles a day! At lunch, they walked in the parking lot. If they knew they had a conference call, suddenly they were out doing it on their cell phones while they walked! Because of the competition, they found ways to increase their activity. Everyone\u2019s steps were tracked, and the whole offi  ce could see who was slacking off and who was stepping up. People\u2019s step tallies increased every day. \nYet as soon as the competition was over, I was fascinated to \nobserve that the step count completely dropped off the cliff\u2014by more than 60 percent just one month after the competition.

Objects in motion tend to stay in motion, unless something stops their momentum. Put another way, couch potatoes tend to stay couch potatoes. Achievers\u2014people who get into a successful rhythm\u2014continue busting their butts and end up achieving more and more. \nIt\u2019s not easy to build momentum, but once you do, look out! \nDo you remember playing on merry-go-rounds when you were a kid? A bunch of your friends piled on, weighing the thing down and then chanted as you worked to get the thing moving. Getting started was slow going. The fi  rst step was always the hardest\u2014getting it to move from a standstill. You had to push and pull, grimace and groan and throw your entire your body into the effort. One step, two steps, three steps\u2014it seemed like you were getting nowhere. After a long and hard effort, fi  nally you were able to get up a little bit of speed and run along side it. Even though you were moving (and your friends were cheering louder), to get the speed you really wanted, you had to keep running faster and faster, pulling it behind you as you ran with all your might. Finally, success! You jumped on and joined your friends in the joy of feeling the wind in your face and watching the outside world turn into a smear of colors. After a while, when the merry-go-round started to slow down, you\u2019d hop off and run alongside for a minute to get the speed back up\u2014or you could simply give it a couple good pushes and then hop back on. Once the merry-go-round was spinning at a good clip, momentum took over, making it easy to keep it going. \nChapter_4.indd   94Chapter_4.indd   94 4/21/10   1:02:09 PM4/21/10   1:02:09 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1901, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac17d119-3146-451b-9158-bd025bd8cc5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac17d119-3146-451b-9158-bd025bd8cc5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_115.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_115.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52117, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_115", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_115.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_115.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52117, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "35d23aeabb6d9234eeb612b92ceb0301c1ac13768b16c4fa1a3e7331681cf90d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d35195c5-7ee7-480e-8644-4a25fce328b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_114.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_114.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 62590, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "109c2ecf1382c41a46efb51253a279406ea055e736e8b01693ff4278b9f2e528", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fca9f630-a8ff-43d0-aee5-116f03f05347", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b4c4b7c95ebb8ac5b12ca4ab6bbf23edfb18ccb27f8ad5a0904556312410f26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "95 MOMENTUM\nAdopting any change is the same way.

While Mac computers have always had an intensely loyal following, they still comprise a small fraction of the overall PC market. The iPod certainly wasn\u2019t the fi  rst MP3 player out there; Apple was actually late to the game. But they had something powerful going for them: the consistency of their efforts in maintaining customer loyalty, a steadfast commitment to high quality, innovative design, and ease of use.

To reach new goals and develop new habits, it\u2019s necessary to create new routines to support your objectives. \nThe greater the challenge, the more rigorous our routines need \nto be. Ever wonder why military boot camp is so hard\u2014where relatively minor tasks like making the bed, shining your shoes, or standing at attention become over-the-top important? Building routines to prep soldiers for combat is the most effective way to elicit effi  cient, productive, and reliable performance under intense pressure. The seemingly simplistic routines built and developed during basic training are so exact that soft, fearful, slovenly teenagers are transformed into lean, confi  dent, mission-driven soldiers in only eight to twelve weeks. Their routines are so well-rehearsed that these young soldiers can instinctively act with precision in the middle of the chaos of combat.

Developing a routine of predictable, daily disciplines prepares you to be victorious on the battlefi  eld of life. \nGolfer Jack Nicklaus was famous for his pre-shot routine. He was \nreligious about the \u201cdance\u201d he would do before every shot, a series of routine mental and physical steps that got him fully focused and ready for the shot. Jack would start out behind the ball, and then pick out one or two intermediate spots between the ball and the target. As he walked around and approached the ball, the fi  rst thing he would do is line up his clubface to his intermediate target. He wouldn\u2019t put his feet into position until he felt he had his clubface properly squared up. Then he would take his stance. From there, he would waggle the club and look out to his target, then back to his intermediate target and back to the golf club, with a repeat of the view. Then, and only then, would he strike the ball. \nDuring one of the important Majors, a psychologist timed \nNicklaus from the moment he pulled the club out of the bag until the moment he hit the ball, and guess what? In each shot, from the fi  rst tee to the eighteenth green, the timing of Jack\u2019s routine supposedly never varied more than one second. That is \namazing! The same psychologist measured Greg Norman during his unfortunate collapse at the 1996 Masters. Lo and behold, his pre-shot routine got faster and faster as the round progressed. Varying his routine stunted his rhythm and consistency; he was never able to catch momentum.

Predictably, without a pre-kick routine, their performance under time pressure greatly diminishes. Pilots go through their prefl  ight checklist. Even when a pilot has logged thousands of hours and the plane just came in with a \u201cperfect\u201d performance review from a previous destination, the pilot goes through a prefl  ight checklist every time without fail. This not only prepares the plane, but, more important, centers the pilot and prepares him for the upcoming performance. \nOf all the high-achievers and business owners I\u2019ve worked \nwith, I\u2019ve seen that, along with good habits, each has developed routines for accomplishing necessary daily disciplines. It\u2019s the only way any of us can predictably regulate our behavior. There simply isn\u2019t any way around it. A daily routine built on good habits and disciplines separates the most successful among us from everyone else. A routine is exceptionally powerful. \nTo create profi  table and effective routines, you must fi  rst \ndecide what behaviors and habits you want to implement. Take a moment to review your goals from Chapter 3, as well as the behaviors you want to add and subtract. Now it\u2019s your turn to be Jack Nicklaus and fi  gure out your best pre-shot routine.

I know I need to attune my mind to abundance. The world looks, acts, and responds to you very differently when you start your day with a feeling and orientation of gratitude for that which you already have. Second, I do something that sounds a bit odd, but I send love to someone. The way to get love is to give it, and one thing I want more of is love.

Otherwise, life gets \nstale and I plateau. An easy example is working out with weights. When I work out the same way at the same time, doing the same repetitive movements week after week, my body stops showing compounded results. I get bored, lose my passion, and big Mo is a no-show.

Most of the time it\u2019s nothing earth-shattering, but things such as eating different kinds of foods, taking a class, visiting a new destination, or joining a club to meet new people. This change of pace makes me feel alive, helps recapture my passion, and offers me opportunities for fresh perspectives. \nLook at your routines.

For instance, \nin looking again at my goal of deepening the love and intimacy of my marriage, I designed a weekly, monthly, and quarterly rhythm schedule. Doesn\u2019t sound too romantic, I know. But maybe you\u2019ve noticed that, even when something\u2019s a high priority for you, if it isn\u2019t scheduled on your calendar, it often doesn\u2019t happen, right? Certainly not with the regularity you\u2019ll need to get into any kind of rhythm. \nHere\u2019s how it works. Every Friday night is \u201cdate night,\u201d and \nGeorgia and I go out or do something special together. At 6 p.m., an alarm goes off on both our iPhones, and no matter what we\u2019re doing, date night is on! Every Saturday is FD (Family Day)\u2014which means NO working. Essentially sundown on Friday night until sunup on Sunday morning is time we devote to the marriage and family. If you don\u2019t create these boundaries, one day has a tendency to fl  ow into the next. Unfortunately, the people who get shoved aside are often the most important. \nEvery Sunday night, also at 6 p.m., we have our RR (Relationship \nReview). This is a practice I picked up from relationship experts Linda and Richard Eyre during an interview I did with them for our October 2009 SUCCESS Audio Series. During this time, we discuss the previous week\u2019s wins, losses, as well as the adjustments we need to make in our relationship. We start the conversation by telling each other a few things we have appreciated about the other during the previous week\u2014it\u2019s helpful to start with the good stuff. Then, using an idea I picked up from my interview with Jack Canfi  eld, we ask each other, \u201cOn a scale of one to ten (ten being the best), how would you rate our relationship this week?\u201d This gets the discussion of wins and losses fl  owing\u2014oh, boy! Then we discuss the adjustments that need to be made through this follow-up question: \u201cWhat would it take to make \nChapter_4.indd   107Chapter_4.indd   107 4/21/10   1:02:49 PM4/21/10   1:02:49 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2004, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f467068-e0bf-4f28-8eb3-d686dea6c3ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f467068-e0bf-4f28-8eb3-d686dea6c3ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_128.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_128.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52249, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_128", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_128.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_128.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52249, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "ca94fa1f29ae1bed571d6b9ed5e3d1ecdf5f0e4d033c23f42706172005e4bdb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bacb523a-55a3-4ff9-a9f3-0a618d8165fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_127.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_127.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 43091, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "3118db6ac50e0a3d88a7f9f565f0eea19161aa59f2ee09be65662e7e6cc55234", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79f73990-2548-454f-9f0e-5917e178a3db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04780da7366271fc6f8de43345e8178b5e5dc6b10a6b1bef52bf18838f543317", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "108 THE COMPOUND EFFECT\nyour experience a ten?\u201d By the end of the discussion, both of us feel heard and validated, and we have made our observations and wishes clear moving into the next week.

Jim Rohn taught me that life is simply a collection of experiences; our goal should be to increase the frequency and the intensity of the good experiences. Once a month we try to do something that creates an experience that has some memorable intensity. It could be driving up to the mountains, going on an adventurous hike, driving up to Los Angeles to try a new fancy restaurant, going sailing in the bay\u2014whatever. Something out of the ordinary that has a heightened experience and creates an indelible memory. \nOnce a quarter we plan a two- to three-day getaway. I like to \ndo a quarterly review of all my goals and life patterns, and this is a great time to do a deeper check-in on how things are going in our relationship.

He thought he was going to be able to stick with his new routine for a lifetime. For someone who\u2019s never worked out to start working out two hours a day, fi  ve days a week, is a surefi  re dead end. You have to build a program that you can do for fi  fty years, not fi  ve weeks, or fi  ve months. It\u2019s okay if you go strong for a while, but you\u2019ve got to see light at the end of the tunnel where you can start scaling it back. You can always fi  nd forty-fi  ve minutes to an hour a few times a week, but to fi  nd two \nhours, fi  ve days a week, to make your routine work, that\u2019ll never happen. Remember, consistency is a critical component of success. \nThe Power of Consistency \nI\u2019ve mentioned that if there\u2019s one discipline that gives me a \ncompetitive advantage, it\u2019s my ability to be consistent. Nothing kills Big Mo quicker and with more certainty than a lack of consistency. Even good, passionate, and ambitious people with good intentions can fall short when it comes to consistency. But it\u2019s a powerful tool you can use to launch the fl  ight toward your goals. \nThink of it like this: If you and I fl  ew planes from Los Angeles to \nManhattan, but you took off and landed in every state in between, while I fl  ew straight through, even if you went fi  ve hundred miles \nper hour in the air and I only traveled at a rate of two hundred miles per hour, I\u2019d still beat you by a big margin. The time and energy it takes for you to repeatedly stop and start and get back to momentum make your trip at least ten times as long. In fact, most likely you wouldn\u2019t even make it\u2014you\u2019d run out of fuel (energy, motivation, belief, will) at some point. It\u2019s far easier and requires a \nChapter_4.indd   112Chapter_4.indd   112 4/21/10   1:03:05 PM4/21/10   1:03:05 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1895, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "776ba8fe-f6db-4890-8b0d-fa7e0c4ca2ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "776ba8fe-f6db-4890-8b0d-fa7e0c4ca2ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_133.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_133.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 54615, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_133", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_133.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_133.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 54615, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "38159cf3b7c6ea8fa560c1d5fea13e3309ffbb8cf98108e02450763743c8376b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1300ed62-e7aa-412a-b72c-63eafe805e47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_132.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_132.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52387, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "80723c269f4c03e504015e3da6cf4cde01867e1e0833bfae8b300aec97b19f5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9230416c-9ca3-4952-9d24-33def72a6b90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e054d16880446bb4f9024ab243c48faeef92f7e041283535aeb9a515c91c21f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "113 MOMENTUM\nlot less energy to take off once and maintain a regular speed (even \nif slower than most everyone else) all along the way. \nThe Pump Well\nWhen you start thinking about slacking off on your routines \nand rhythms, consider the massive cost of inconsistency.

Just as Richard was with his plan to get fi  t, they\u2019re excited and committed\u2026 they pump and pump and pump, but after a few minutes (or a few weeks), when they don\u2019t see any water (results), they give up pumping the lever altogether. They don\u2019t realize how long it takes to create the vacuum needed to suck the water into the pipe and eventually out of the spout and into their bucket. Just like the merry-go-round, rocket ship, or steam engine breaking free of inertia, it takes time, massive energy, and consistency to pump water. Most people give up, but wise people continue to pump. \nThose who persevere and continue to pump the lever will \neventually get a few drops of water. This is when a lot of people say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me! All this pumping, and for what\u2014a few measly drops? Forget it!\u201d Many people throw their hands up in defeat and quit, but wise people persist further. \nAnd here\u2019s where the magic happens: If you continue to \npump, it doesn\u2019t take long before you\u2019ll get a full and steady stream of water. You have your success! Now that the water is fl  owing, you no longer need to pump the lever as hard or as quickly. It becomes easy, actually. All you have to do to keep the pressure steady is to just pump the lever consistently. That\u2019s \nthe Compound Effect. \nNow, what happens if you let go of the lever for too long? \nThe water falls back down into the ground, and you\u2019re back to square one. If you try to pump the lever easily and steadily, you won\u2019t get any water. Mo is gone; water is at the bottom.

That\u2019s how most of us lead our lives, in fi  ts and starts. We get a new business venture going, and then cut out on vacation. We start up a routine of making ten prospecting calls a day, strike a little gold, and then shift into neutral. We get hopped up about our new \u201cdate night\u201d routine with our spouse, but in a few weeks, it\u2019s back to Netfl  ix and microwave popcorn on the couch Friday nights.

Input: Garbage In, Garbage Out \nIf you want your body to run at peak performance, you\u2019ve \ngot to be vigilant about consuming the highest-quality nutrients and avoiding tempting junk food. If you want your brain to perform at its peak, you\u2019ve got to be even more vigilant about what you feed it. Are you feeding it news summaries or mind-numbing sitcoms? Are you reading the tabloids, or SUCCESS? \nControlling the input has a direct and measurable impact on your productivity and outcomes. \nControlling what our brains consume is especially diffi  cult \nbecause so much of what we take in is unconscious. Although it\u2019s true that we can eat without thinking, it\u2019s easier to pay attention to what we put in our bodies because food doesn\u2019t leap into our mouths. We need an extra level of vigilance to prevent our brains from absorbing irrelevant, counterproductive or downright destructive input. It\u2019s a never-ending battle to be selective and to stand guard against any information that can derail your creative potential. \nYour brain is not designed to make you happy. Your brain \nhas only one agenda in mind: survival.

But today, instead of three news TV and radio networks, there are hundreds, running 24/7. Instead of a few newspapers, there are endless portals reaching us from our computers to our phones. The competition for your attention has never been bloodier, and the media jockeys continually up the ante in shock value. They fi  nd a dozen or so of the most heinous, scandalous, criminal, murderous, bleak, and horrid things that happen in the world each day, and parade them through our papers, news channels, and the Web over and over. Meanwhile, during that same twenty-four-hour period, millions of wonderful, beautiful, incredible things have happened. Yet we hear very little about them.

Rohn would say we could tell the quality of our health, attitude, and income by looking at the people around us. The people with whom we spend our time determine what conversations dominate our attention, and to which attitudes and opinions we are regularly exposed. Eventually, we start to eat what they eat, talk like they talk, read what they read, think like they think, watch what they watch, treat people how they treat them, even dress like they dress.

Meanwhile, your other friends order healthy food and talk about the inspiring books they\u2019re reading and their ambitions in their businesses, and you begin to assimilate their behaviors and habits. You read and talk about what they talk about, you see the movies they\u2019re excited about, and you go to the places they recommend. The infl  uence your friends have over you is subtle and can be positive or negative; either way, the impact is incredibly powerful. Watch out! You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. \nSo, what is the combined average income, health, or attitudes \nof the fi  ve people you spend most of your time with? Does the answer frighten you? If so, the best way to increase your potential for whatever traits you desire is to spend the majority of your time with people who already possess those traits.

If you\u2019ve ever been to Monaco, that\u2019s what Tiburon looks like, but far quainter. It\u2019s a spectacular spot. I would go to a delightful seafood restaurant, Sam\u2019s on the Wharf.

I was mesmerized by the multimillion-dollar houses that hung off the cliffs. One in particular always caught my eye\u2014a blue, four-story home with an elevator and a whale lightning rod at the top. What would be \nthe perfect house? I used to ask myself all the time. If someone could \njust give me one of them, which one would I pick?

It was in the perfect spot with a bright vista, the best of the bunch. \nOn my way home from brunch one morning, I saw an open house \nsign and thought it\u2019d be fun to check it out. One sign led to another as I followed them zigzagging up the cliffs along the narrow streets. I fi  nally reached the top of the hill and found the advertised home.

However, that environment had a powerful effect on me. Seeing those homes up on the cliffs fueled my ambition and expanded my dreams. I ended up working harder than I ever thought possible to make those dreams come true\u2014and they did! \nThe dream in your heart may be bigger than the environment \nin which you fi  nd yourself. Sometimes you have to get out of that environment to see that dream fulfi  lled. It\u2019s like planting an oak sapling in a pot. Once it becomes rootbound, its growth is limited. It needs a great space to become a mighty oak. So do you. \nWhen I talk about your environment, I\u2019m not just referring to \nwhere you live. I\u2019m referring to whatever surrounds you. Creating a positive environment to support your success means clearing out all the clutter in your life. Not just the physical clutter that makes it hard for you to work productively and effi  ciently (although that\u2019s important too!), but also the psychic clutter of whatever around you isn\u2019t working, whatever\u2019s broken, whatever makes you cringe. Each and every incomplete thing in your life exerts a draining force on you, sucking the energy of accomplishment and success out of you as surely as a vampire stealing your blood. Every incomplete promise, commitment, and agreement saps your strength because it blocks your momentum and inhibits your ability to move forward. Incomplete tasks keep calling you back to the past to take care of them. So think about what you can complete today. \nAdditionally, when you\u2019re creating an environment to support \nyour goals, remember that you get in life what you tolerate . \nChapter_5.indd   138Chapter_5.indd   138 4/21/10   1:04:28 PM4/21/10   1:04:28 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1883, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29d12f63-3dcb-4534-bf69-6ce23a77a0fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "29d12f63-3dcb-4534-bf69-6ce23a77a0fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_159.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_159.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52970, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_159", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_159.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_159.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 52970, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "ed5c492334760ff8b9e2564ffbf58fb94913b804b9973f72de34b7c33cd71153", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6461ea8-324a-47ca-9a4b-ef312a4df0dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_158.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_158.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 61809, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "dee1a3c30b90de55814b47b37b85d6e2fe06b1a1cfea666e04ae9863c258959a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3f61013-afa3-47c3-a08c-c0d9c3960977", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "589a93035a9ff858b0a79cfe1af527e1106eca2be07f208f41702a5c2759c683", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "139 INFLUENCES\nThis is true in every area of your life\u2014particularly within your relationships with family, friends, and colleagues.

On October 30, 1974, Ali regained his heavyweight championship, besting George Foreman in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history in the \u201cRumble in the Jungle.\u201d Almost no one, not even Ali\u2019s longtime supporter Howard Cosell, believed the former champion had a chance of winning. Both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton had beaten Ali previously, and George Foreman had knocked both of them out in only the second round. Ali\u2019s strategy?

This is when Ali came up with the tactic later termed \u201cRope-a-Dope.\u201d Ali would lean on the ropes, shielding his face, while Foreman threw hundreds of punches over seven rounds. By the eighth round, Foreman was exhausted; he was at his wall. It was then that Ali dropped Foreman with a combination at center ring. \nHitting the wall isn\u2019t an obstacle; it\u2019s an opportunity. During \nLance Armstrong\u2019s second attempt at winning the Tour de France, it was once again time to head into the mountains. The fi  rst big climb would be where Lance had experienced a devastating crash earlier that same year, giving him a concussion and breaking his seventh lumbar vertebra during a wet day in the spring. Now it was raining yet again. Instead of being concerned or hesitant, he said, \u201cThis is perfect attacking weather, mainly because I know the others don\u2019t like it. I believe that nobody in the world is better at suffering. It\u2019s a good day for me.\u201d He was right. Lance brought home his second victory. \nWhen conditions are great, things are easy, there aren\u2019t any \ndistractions, no one is interrupting, temptations aren\u2019t luring, and nothing is disturbing your stride; that too is when most everyone else does great. It\u2019s not until situations are diffi  cult, when problems come up and temptation is great, that you get to prove your worthiness for progress. As Jim Rohn would say, \u201cDon\u2019t wish it were easier; wish you were better.\u201d \nWhen you hit the wall in your disciplines, routines, rhythms, \nand consistency, realize that\u2019s when you are separating yourself from your old self, scaling that wall, and fi  nding your new powerful, triumphant, and victorious self. \nChapter_6.indd   145Chapter_6.indd   145 4/21/10   1:04:56 PM4/21/10   1:04:56 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1823, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e923c006-01e1-4cff-9f8a-55dc624e06c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e923c006-01e1-4cff-9f8a-55dc624e06c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_165.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_165.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 62375, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_165", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_165.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_165.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 62375, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "430c69adf0d5125666f74bc52e7a2450c3a9ef805fd60c5842370087a4fa06de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "debdbe90-11e7-440f-949a-114667058bae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_164.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_164.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 42792, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "12d59f7f41b06d5cf0fdc2e6e368a3cfa2d2c649342ef91801b40e137fe41f61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "970bb290-1f25-443d-a273-80f1a75fcb8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9397356a150f16de4a32c7cc5f1f304ba1ec5b66dddf98131a30ab3153aa9f07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "146 THE COMPOUND EFFECT\nMultiplying Your Results \nI have an exciting opportunity for you. We\u2019ve talked about \nhow the simple disciplines and behaviors will compound over time, delivering amazingly powerful results for you. What if you could speed up the process and multiply your results? Would you be interested? I want to show you how just a little bit more effort can add exponentially to your outcomes. \nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re weight training and your program calls for you \nto do twelve repetitions of a certain weight. Now, if you do the twelve, you\u2019re fulfi  lling the expectation of your program. Great job. Stay consistent, and ultimately, you will see this discipline compound into powerful results for you. Yet, if you get to twelve, even if you\u2019ve hit your max, and you push out another three to fi  ve reps, your impact on that set will be multiplied several times. You won\u2019t just add a few reps to the aggregate of your workout. No. Those reps done after you hit your max will multiply your \nresults. You\u2019ve just pushed through the wall of your max. The previous reps just got you there. The real growth happens with what you do after you\u2019re at the wall. \nArnold Schwarzenegger made famous a weight training \nmethod called \u201cThe Cheating Principle.\u201d Arnold was a stickler for perfect technique. He contended that once you reached your maximum number of lifts in perfect form, adjusting your wrists or leaning back to recruit other muscles to assist the working muscles (cheating a little) would allow you to do fi  ve or six more reps, which would signifi  cantly improve the results of that set. (You can also achieve this by having a workout partner who assists the last few reps you couldn\u2019t have done on your own.) \nChapter_6.indd   146Chapter_6.indd   146 4/21/10   1:04:59 PM4/21/10   1:04:59 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1808, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "970bb290-1f25-443d-a273-80f1a75fcb8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "970bb290-1f25-443d-a273-80f1a75fcb8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_166.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_166.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 59016, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_166", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_166.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_166.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 59016, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "d10f91762649656600373dada21eb4f3f46db72e6163d224cfa4cfb3f76b1320", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e923c006-01e1-4cff-9f8a-55dc624e06c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_165.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder/page_165.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 62375, "creation_date": "2024-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-18"}, "hash": "430c69adf0d5125666f74bc52e7a2450c3a9ef805fd60c5842370087a4fa06de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7aa5b92-a5e0-4150-953b-66ce6f321079", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "69a225afa844d86d74e65be983f43f11763d177f9c8ed0592d9bbf9c8815f536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "147 ACCELERATION\nIf you\u2019re a runner, you know the experience.

Then the sixth day, having endured harsh weather and sleeping in the rain, the more than fi  ve hundred participants surrounded her studio and stood in silence holding signs starting at 3:30 a.m. That morning Oprah walked out the doors of Harpo Studios, spoke with the organization\u2019s founders and invited the entire group to participate in a live broadcast segment that morning to her more than 20 million viewers. That attention got Invisible Children on Larry King Live  and 232 other \nnews outlets\u2014to reach a total of more than 65 million people. A bill is currently moving through Congress supporting Invisible Children\u2019s efforts to save these children. The organization had already pulled off more than expected with the Rescue event, but the little extra gumption and steadfastness to capture that last city (and the attention of Oprah), gained Invisible Children its biggest advocate to date, multiplying its results many times over. \nFind the line of expectation and then exceed it.

You know the truth about what it takes to earn success. You\u2019ve got no more excuses. Like me, you too will refuse to be fooled by the latest gimmicks or become distracted by quick-fi  x enticements. You will stay focused on the simple but profound disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your desires. You know that success isn\u2019t easy or overnight. You understand that when you\u2019re committed to making moment-to-moment positive choices (despite the lack of visible or instant results), the Compound Effect will catapult you to heights that will astound you, bewilder your friends, family, and your competition. When you hold true to your why-power and stay consistent with your new behaviors and habits, momentum will carry you swiftly forward. And then, together, with that momentum and consistent, positive action, it will be impossible for the next fi  ve years to be more of the same. On the contrary, when you put the Compound Effect to work for you, you will experience a success I\u2019m willing to bet you currently cannot imagine! It will be incredible. \nI have one more valuable success principle to pass along to you. \nWhatever I want in life, I\u2019ve found that the best way to get it is to focus my energy on giving to others. If I want to boost my confi  dence, I look for ways to help someone else feel more confi  dent. If I want to feel more hopeful, positive, and inspired, I try to infuse that in someone else\u2019s day. If I want more success for myself, the fastest way to get it is to go about helping someone else obtain it. \nThe ripple effect of helping others and giving generously of your \ntime and energy is that you become the biggest benefi  ciary of your personal philanthropy. As the fi  rst simple and small step I\u2019d like you to take in improving the trajectory of your life, I ask you to try this philosophy in your own life.
